# Community Store add-on for concrete5

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

An open, free and community developed eCommerce system for concrete5

Please refer to the project wiki for more extended details - https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/wiki

The goal of this project is to provide a stable, feature rich, highly extensible and customizable 'shopping cart toolkit' for concrete5.7 and v8.

At this point the add-on and it's associated payment and shipping methods are functioning well, but should still be considered beta.
If you are not a concrete5 developer and wish to use the Community Store on a production site it is advised that you find a developer to assist you.

The add-on will work directly with a Bootstrap based theme, primarily Elemental, but is intended to be easily modified and overriden for a custom theme.

## Setup
The package can be downloaded, unzipped into the /packages directory (ensuring the folder name is simply 'community_store') and installed via the 'Extend concrete5' option within the dashboard.  It is recommended that a 'release' be used instead of the master branch - https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/releases

## Payment gateways
To keep the 'core' store component as lightweight as possible it does not include a payment gateway other than the 'Invoice' type.
Payment gateways are to be installed as additional add-ons.

Additional gateways can be found at:

### Paypal Standard - https://www.paypal.com

## Addons

## PHP Version
This add-on is intended to support PHP5.6+ onwards, being 100% operational on PHP7.

## Compatibility
Community Store is designed to be  100% compatible with both version 5.7 and v8 of concrete5. Is is recommended that if you are starting a new project to use v8. 

If you are adding Community Store to an exisiting 5.7 and you plan to also upgrade it to v8, upgrade concrete5 _before_ installing Community Store. 

If you have an existing 5.7 site with Community Store and need to upgrade to v8, be aware that the upgrade _does_ work, but there is  one outstanding issue with concrete5's upgrade process that requires the following SQL command to be run on the DB to rectify:
```sql
REPLACE INTO LegacyAttributeKeys (
	SELECT akID FROM Packages 
	LEFT JOIN AttributeKeys
	ON AttributeKeys.pkgID = Packages.pkgID
	WHERE pkgHandle = 'community_store'
	AND akCategory = 'legacykey'
)
```
